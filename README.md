# Student_Performance_recommendation
Educational institutions bear a tremendous burden
in supporting at-risk students, those with low academic performance. Many approaches are used to support this group
of students, such as psychological therapy, adapted timetables,
recall, personal training, mock tests, direct private instruction,
and success centers. However, these methods are insufficient to
address the issue, as other factors, such as family difficulties,
cognitive style, prior performance, and college foundation level,
also influence student success. This paper explores machine
learning models to predict at-risk students and build a recommendation platform to provide direct system-based coaching
to these students to remediate their fragmented knowledge
and skills. Using a dataset of 4000 students in a computer
program, the study aims to break down the curricula into a
set of knowledge and skill crumbs to measure learner progress.
Various machine learning algorithms were evaluated, with the
decision tree achieving the highest accuracy of 97.43% and high
coverage of 97.62% for the ”Good Standing” positive class. Model
optimization was completed, and ROC comparison was used to
evaluate the classifier models. A remediation algorithm was used
to support at-risk cases, resulting in a significant decrease in
the at-risk rate. The study concludes that current approaches to
handling at-risk students exaggerate the problem, and students
should not be treated as a monolithic group.
